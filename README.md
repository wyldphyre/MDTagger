MDTagger
========

A simple script to parse comic issue numbers and titles out of comic archives downloaded with manga_downloader (also on github), and then insert that information into the archive using ComicTagger.

todo:
* Validation of extracted filename data
* Actually save data using ComicTagger
* Implement interactive mode where the user get to decide on each whether each files data is correct and can be saved. Saying no to a file just moves on to the next file
